Simple script for bulk AND single video files conversion to save space.
If needed, adjust options by your choice.
Also suggested to execute this command to prevent PC goes to sleep while ffmpeg running, effect should be persistent so need to run it only once
`powercfg /requestsoverride PROCESS "ffmpeg.exe" DISPLAY SYSTEM AWAYMODE`
